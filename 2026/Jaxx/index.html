                <pre>
1. Uniform Cost: $100 for 2 Jerseys and 2 Hats. 
   Hats are embroidered and cost includes shipping.
   
2. Black and grey pants. Pants are not included in uniform cost above. 

3. Belt and sock color to be determined.

4. I am putting in the jersey sizes and numbers night of 9/8 to Diamond Jaxx.
   Will be bulk order with other teams.
   
5. I'd like uniforms before joining any tournaments.

6. Matching helmets would look nice but a lot of these kids already have multiple helmets.
   I'll let the parents decide this.
                </pre>
                <div class="exported-note-title">Costs</div>
                <div>
                    <pre>
1. No Dues for September (we still have Noble Creek access). 

2. Dues will be around $120, should not be more. Still deciding if dues will be less but I don't want to run this completely barebones. 
  
3. I'd like to take players to cages (d-bat) ~2 times a month.
   
3. Dues start the month we start tournaments on the 1st of that month (we need jerseys first).

4. Starting October 1st I need to start paying for field access, field lights, insurance. 
   This is $200 total split evenly among all players.
   
5. If no tournaments in October dues will be approximately $35.
   $200 across 10 kids for fields/insurance and then we might need to register for USSSA which is ~$85.
   Would also like to do one cage trip to Dbat). Cost can change but should be very low for October.
 
6. In fees I'd like to include a small amount for umpires in scrimmages ~$60.

7. Dues for a month can potentially change depending on factors such as joining more expensive tournaments for that month.
   There will be full transparency in this and all costs will be explained.

8. Some of these tournaments have gate fees. These fees are the responsibility of each family separate of any team dues.

1. If anyone wants to volunteer for walk-up songs please let me know.

2. If anyone wants to run gamechanger please let me know.

3. If anyone wants to handle the money/dues please let me know. 
   I'd prefer not to but will if required.
   
4. If anyone has scrimmage teams in mind please let me know. 
   We can host on Monday and Wednesday or can travel for other days.
   
5. Communication will eventually be over GroupMe app.
